/**
 * binary_tree_height - Measures the height of a binary tree
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to measure

 * Description:
 * The height is defined as the number of edges on the longest path
 * from the node to a leaf. If the tree is NULL, the function returns -1.
 * A leaf node has a height of 0.
 *
 * Return: Height of the tree, or -1 if tree is NULL
